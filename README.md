# Toxic-comment-classifier
Built a binary toxic comment classifier using bert-base-uncased with Hugging Face Transformers. The model was fine-tuned on the llangnickel/long-covid-classification-data dataset (repurposed for toxicity classification) using PyTorch. It includes training, evaluation, saving, and inference via the pipeline() API.
